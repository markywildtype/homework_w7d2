1. What is one benefit of using generics in Java classes?
It gives us the ability to decide what type our properties will be at the time of instantiation without having to create a duplicate class with an alternative type option. As opposed to being constrained by predefined types, as with a standard class.

2. Name an example of a generic class that we have used in Java?
An ArrayList.

3. What is the syntax for declaring a generic class?
public class NameOfClass<T> {}

4. At what point does the generic type get specified?
At the point of instantiation of an object of that class.

5. Can generic types be of primitive type?
No, they have to be Object types, eg. Integer or String.

6. Can a generic class take more than one type parameters?
Yes, and they are referred to as 'parameterized' if they do so.
